Synopsis

    The script module takes the script name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
    The local script at path will be transferred to the remote node and then executed.
    The given script will be processed through the shell environment on the remote node.
    This module does not require python on the remote system, much like the raw module.
    This module is also supported for Windows targets.

# Example from Ansible Playbooks
- script: /some/local/script.sh --some-arguments 1234

# Run a script that creates a file, but only if the file is not yet created
- script: /some/local/create_file.sh --some-arguments 1234
  args:
    creates: /the/created/file.txt

# Run a script that removes a file, but only if the file is not yet removed
- script: /some/local/remove_file.sh --some-arguments 1234
  args:
