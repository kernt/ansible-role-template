And you will see the following fact added:

"ansible_local": {
        "preferences": {
            "general": {
                "asdf" : "1",
                "bar"  : "2"
            }
        }
 }

And this data can be accessed in a template/playbook as:

{{ ansible_local['preferences']['general']['asdf'] }}

Accessing complex variable data

We already described facts a little higher up in the documentation.

Some provided facts, like networking information, are made available as nested data structures. To access them a simple {{ foo }} is not sufficient, but it is still easy to do. Hereâ€™s how we get an IP address:

{{ ansible_facts["eth0"]["ipv4"]["address"] }}

OR alternatively:

{{ ansible_facts.eth0.ipv4.address }}

Similarly, this is how we access the first element of an array:

{{ foo[0] }}
